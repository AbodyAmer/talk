In order to facilitate compliance with the
[EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://www.eugdpr.org/), you
can enable the following plugins:

- [talk-plugin-auth](/talk/plugin/talk-plugin-auth) - to facilitate username and password changes
- [talk-plugin-local-auth](/talk/plugin/talk-plugin-local-auth) - to facilitate email changes and email association
- [talk-plugin-profile-data](/talk/plugin/talk-plugin-profile-data) - to facilitate account download and deletion

Even if you don't reside in a location where GDPR will apply, it is recommended
to enable these features anyways to provide your users with control over their
own data.

## Custom Authentication Solutions

As many of the newsrooms who have integrated Talk have followed our guides on
[Integrating Authentication](/talk/integrating/authentication/), we have also
provided tools for those newsrooms to integrate GDPR features into their
existing workflows.

### Account Data

Through the [talk-plugin-profile-data](/talk/plugin/talk-plugin-profile-data)
plugin we allow users to download and delete their account data easily. For
custom integrations, this isn't always possible, so we instead provide some
GraphQL mutations designed to allow you to integrate it into your existing user
interfaces or exports.

- `downloadUser(id: ID!)` - lets you grab the direct link to download a users
  account in a zip format. From there, you can integrate it into your existing
  data export or simply proxy it to the user to allow them to download it
  elsewhere in your UI.
- `delUser(id: ID!)` - lets you delete the specified user

**Note: These mutations require an administrative token**

If you would prefer to write your own user interfaces or integrate it into your
own, you can disable the client plugin for [talk-plugin-profile-data](/talk/plugin/talk-plugin-profile-data)
but keep the server side plugin active (See [Server and Client Plugins](/talk/plugins/#server-and-client-plugins) for more information).
