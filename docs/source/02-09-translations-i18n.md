We’re so proud to have received submissions from a lot of 3rd party contributors translating Talk into their own languages.

You can see what languages Talk currently supports here: https://github.com/coralproject/talk/tree/master/locales

To add a new Talk translation, simply translate the `en.yml` file (https://github.com/coralproject/talk/blob/master/locales/en.yml) into a new yml file with the language code of your choice. You can find supported language codes here: http://www.localeplanet.com/icu/iso639.html

There are some other files you will need to update, which you can do, or you can simply leave that to us!

If you want to suggest a new language or put a placeholder for a translation you’re working on, feel free to create a Github issue: https://github.com/coralproject/talk/issues/new
