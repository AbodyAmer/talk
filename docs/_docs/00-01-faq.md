### My site doesn't use HSTS headers, how do I stop Talk from sending them too?

You can specify the configuration option `TALK_HELMET_CONFIGURATION` and set it
to:

```
TALK_HELMET_CONFIGURATION={"hsts": false}
```

Which will disable the HSTS module. See the
[helmet](https://github.com/helmetjs/helmet) repository for more information on
how to configure other security middleware used by default.

### How are new stories/assets added to Talk? Is there an API?

There are three ways that new assets can make their way into Talk:

- Just in time
- Active
- Manual

#### Just in Time asset creation

Talk ships with a _just in time_ mechanism that works out of the box without
integration with any CMS or manual work needed.

The _just in time_ flow looks like this:

* Request comes in for a stream on an asset that doesn't yet exist.
* Talk screens the domain against the domain whitelist, fails if doesn't pass.
* Then, concurrently
  * Talk creates a new asset record and returns the stream data (which will be
    empty)
  * Schedules a job to scrape the new page and fill in asset information.

The scraping mechanism utilizes
[metascraper](https://www.npmjs.com/package/metascraper) and is queued using the
[Que](https://www.npmjs.com/package/kue). If your Talk deployments is configured
to run separate job worker cluster, scraping will be performed by them.

#### Active (or push based) asset creation

If tighter CMS integration is required to push custom data into assets and/or
keep data in sync as changes are made in a CMS an _active_ push based workflow
must be implemented.

This is an ideal candidate for a plugin. If you are interested in working on it,
please [contact us](https://coralproject.net/contact)!

#### Manual asset creation

Sometimes you want to load a lot of assets into the database. The most common
use case for this is populating the database during an initial installation. We
recommend writing a script that transforms the data from it's source and inserts
it into the _assets_ collection.

For current schema information, please see the
[asset model](https://github.com/coralproject/talk/blob/master/models/asset.js).

### Where are your http API docs?

Coral relies on GraphQL for the vast majority of it's client and server
communication. All core queries, mutations and subscriptions are defined along
with types and comments in our central
[TypeDef](https://github.com/coralproject/talk/blob/master/graph/typeDefs.graphql).
For plugin graph api typedefs, see each plugin's `/server/` directory.

In addition, Talk Server ships with
[GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql). GraphiQL provides a full data
layer IDE including interactive documentation. The autocomplete and
documentation are populated from introspection meaning that Core _and plugin_
apis can be explored.

To access GraphiQL:

* [Install Talk](install-source).
* Open http://localhost:3000/api/v1/graph/iql in your browser. (Note, your server an port may differ.)

### Where is documentation for a specific component?

We strive for clear inline documentation across our codebase, but have gaps.
Contributions to documentation would be greatly appreciated and is a great way
to start contributing to the project!

If you are considering changing a core component (aka, one that is not in a
plugin), you are entering the realm of a core developer. We strongly ask that
you reach out the coral team before forking and changing core code. We are glad
to help talk through your product need and come up with a strategy for
implementing as a plugin, or working with you to extend the plugin API for your
use case.

### How do I contribute to these docs?

Contributions to the docs are much appreciated and a great way to get involved
in the project.

Fork the Talk repo, clone it locally (no need to go through the install from
source process), then:

```
cd docs
docker run --rm --volume=$PWD:/srv/jekyll -p 127.0.0.1:4000:4000 -it jekyll/jekyll:pages bash -c "bundle install && jekyll serve"
```

You can edit the files in docs with any editor and view the live updates in a
browser by hitting From the docs directory. Then visit:
[http://127.0.0.1:4000/talk/](http://127.0.0.1:4000/talk/).

Once you've made the changes, file a PR back to the `coralproject/talk`
repository.
