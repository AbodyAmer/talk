## Configuring an Individual Stream

There are two ways Admins can configure Talk - the first is via the Configure tab on the comment stream.

### Enable Pre-moderation

Allows toggling pre-moderation for the current comment stream.

### Pre-moderation Comments Containing Links

Allows toggling of pre-moderating comments that have links.

### Ask Readers a Question & Question Icons

Admins can choose to Ask Readers a Question in order to help guide the discussion. [Read more about why this is important on our blog](https://blog.coralproject.net/the-empty-box/).

Admins can also use different icons to display different messaging other than a question on a particular stream, like an announcement or general information about the story.

### Closing a Stream

Admins can close a comment stream which disallows new comments. Previous comments will remain displayed on the stream for readers to view.
