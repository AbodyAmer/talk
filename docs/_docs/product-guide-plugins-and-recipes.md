### Default Plugins

The default Talk plugins can be found in the `plugins.default.json` file [here](https://github.com/coralproject/talk/blob/master/plugins.default.json).

Talk ships out of the box with these plugins:

#### Auth `talk-plugin-auth`

Enables generic registration via an email address, a username, a password, and a password confirmation. To sync Talk auth with your own auth systems, you can use this plugin as a template.

#### Facebook Auth `talk-plugin-facebook-auth`

Enables sign-in via Facebook.

#### Comment Content `talk-plugin-comment-content`

Pluginizes the text of a comment to support custom treatment of this text. By default, we linkify urls so they are clickable.  

#### Respect `talk-plugin-respect`

Enables a Respect reaction button. Why a “respect” button, you ask? [Read more here](https://mediaengagement.org/research/engagement-buttons/). 

#### Ignore User `talk-plugin-ignore-user`

Enables ability for users to ignore (or “mute”) other users. If a user is ignored, you will not see any of their comments. You can un-ignore a user via the My Profile tab.

#### Permalinks `talk-plugin-permalink`

#### Featured Comments `talk-plugin-featured-comments`   

Enables the ability for Moderators to feature and un-feature comments via the Stream and the Admin. Featured comments show in a first-place tab on the Stream if there are any featured comments on that story.  

#### Viewing Options `talk-plugin-viewing-options`

##### Sorting Options `talk-plugin-sort-newest`, `talk-plugin-sort-oldest`, `talk-plugin-most-respected`, `talk-plugin-most-replied`

##### Off-topic `talk-plugin-offtopic`

#### Author Menu `talk-plugin-author-menu`

##### Member Since `talk-plugin-member-since`

#### In-Stream Moderation `talk-plugin-moderation-actions`

Enables in-stream moderation so that Moderators can reject, approve, and feature comments, as well as ban users, directly from the comment stream.

#### Moderation Flag Details `talk-plugin-flag-details`

Enables other plugins to use the Flag Details area of comments in the Moderation Queues to display data.
